# Code Setup Instructions

Create a folder in a known location on your system.

For me, this folder was called "Final Project". Its path was: /Users/spencerhart/Desktop/Digital Signal Processing/Final Project
You can choose your own folder name. This folder will hold both your design code and a subfolder containing Python libraries and other necessary files to run Mediapipe and OpenCV.

From VS Code (or your preferred coding environment), open this folder.

While inside this folder, open a terminal window in the coding environment. Next, you will create the subfolder within a virtual environment. To do this, enter the following into the terminal:

> python3 -m venv myenv

Here, I named my subfolder "myenv". Once again, you can choose your own subfolder name.

Next:

> source myenv/mybin/activate






OR, FOR WINDOWS OS: 
> python -m venv myenv
> myenv\Scripts\activate
