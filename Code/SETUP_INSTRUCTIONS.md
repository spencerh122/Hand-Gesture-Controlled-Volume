# Pictures

## This folder contains pictures of several steps along our development.

- **Version 1**
  - This was the proof of concept airplane, and the only one that successfully flew at all. It was intended to allow us to learn how to make an airplane that could actually fly so that we would have a stable testbed to work off of. This picture was taken after several crashes.
